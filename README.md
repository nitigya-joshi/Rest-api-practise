# Rest-api-practise
This is just a demo Rest api that I made for the purpose of learning.

To change data in the database, you have to run this command:-

# node productDB.js

To run api, use this:-

# npm run dev

To access the api on the cloud, use this link:-

rest-api-practise-production.up.railway.app

Use these routes to navigate:-
rest-api-practise-production.up.railway.app/api/products
rest-api-practise-production.up.railway.app/api/products/testing

For special queries, pls check the code:-
We can get sorted results, selected results, etc. I have also included pagination and limit on number of results per page of api.
