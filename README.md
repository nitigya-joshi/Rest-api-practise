# Rest-api-practise
This is just a demo Rest api that I made for the purpose of learning.
<hr>

To change data in the database, you have to run this command:-

```
node productDB.js
```

To run api, use this:-

```
npm run dev
```
<hr>
To access the api on the cloud, use this link:-

[API root directory](rest-api-practise-production.up.railway.app)

Use these routes to navigate:-

[Products api](rest-api-practise-production.up.railway.app/api/products)

[API testing page](rest-api-practise-production.up.railway.app/api/products/testing)

<hr>
For special queries, pls check the code.

We can get sorted results, selected results, etc. I have also included pagination and limit on number of results per page of api.
